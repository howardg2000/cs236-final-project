Simulation can be ran by specifying the transition probability parameters and other hyperparameters in `simulate.py` and then running `python simulate.py`.

Single or multiple plots can be generated with `plot_single_graph.py` and `plot_multiple_graphs.py` respectively after changing the relevant transition probability parameters.
